# Welcome

This is a sandbox repository. Things can be created and destroyed and played with at random here. 

Don't be shy; have fun. To get started: ask for edit access by [opening an issue](https://github.com/7yl4r/github-lessons-usf/issues)!

This repo is associated with the USF Libraries workshop "GitHub 101".
Slides for that presentation can be found [here](https://dub.sh/github101usf).


# Branches
## gh-pages
The `gh-pages` branch contains files that were copied from an instructional materials template. 
The history of commits there is expansive.
Additionally `gh-pages` is a **special** branch name in GitHub; this is a branch name that is commonly used to create "GitHub Pages" websites.

# Fancy Markdown
**Markdown** is a fancy *markup* language that allows you to add formatting to raw text.
This README.md is a markdown document including examples.
More details can be found on [the markdown wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## "Badges" using markdown image links
For software packages, *badges* are often included in the README to show the status of the package.
These badges are images served from a 3rd party who keeps track of the package status, and updates the image at your link.
Below is an example badge.
