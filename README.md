# Welcome

This is a sandbox repository. Things can be created and destroyed and played with at random here. 

Don't be shy; have fun. To get started: ask for edit access by [opening an issue](https://github.com/7yl4r/github-lessons-usf/issues)!

# Cat
Before doing any further work please take a moment to view the picure of my cat which I have uploaded to the root of the repository.
